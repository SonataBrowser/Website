                                        We are a non-profit group of techies in a mission to produce a great browser in terms of user experience, human ergonomics and work efficiency with little to no sacrifice in performance. <br/><br/>
                                        Over the last 15 years we've identified the benefits and pitfalls of the ongoing browsers and we believe that we've managed to break down the formula of how to create a fully configurable browser that truly adapts to the user.<br/><br/>
